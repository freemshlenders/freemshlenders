Determining how much you can afford should include not just the loanâ€™s principal amount, but also the interest rate and other fees you might have to pay. Compared to traditional business loans, short-term small business loan interest rates and fees are usually higher, increasing the overall cost of the loan.

If you have no prior business credit history or bad credit, you still have several options available for emergency business loans, but be prepared to pay higher interest rates and fees than a business with good credit.

A business loan calculator can help you determine your payments in different scenarios and compare loan offers to choose which emergency business loan best fits your budget.
