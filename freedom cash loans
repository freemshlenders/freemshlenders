Short-term lenders have different credit score requirements. The greater the risk a lender takes in securing a loan for your business, the stricter loan requirements typically are. Not only do alternative lenders, like peer-to-peer lenders and crowdfunding opportunities, offer a wide range of short-term business loans, they usually have looser credit requirements than other lenders.

Most alternative lenders have a minimum credit score requirement of 500 to 625, but you can still get approved if you have a lower credit score. This option may be the right fit if you need an emergency business loan with the fastest funding and simplified application process. Just be prepared to pay a higher interest rate and APR.
